                Maharshi Durvasa along with other Rishis did penance on the banks of the Tunga which later was known as Durvasakshetra. The Maharshi got that name as he used to drink Durvaras (Juice of Garike grass). The juice was stored in earthen pots which tasted sweet and sevral times the gopalas ( boys rearing cattle) used to discover these pots and drink the grass juice. They used to recognise this place as Sihimoge (pot containing sweet juice)/Kumbhapuri means a place of earthen pot. Later this Sihimoge changed in to Shimoga in the period of British rule. Another history is During Shivappa Nayaka period this city was named as Shivamukha. This may have also turned to pronounce as Shimoga in British rule.</p>
